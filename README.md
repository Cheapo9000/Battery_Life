For the Global Game Jam 2011 we used C# in XNA. We used XNA so that we wouldn't 
have to worry about a lot of the low level technology during development. 
Our team consisted of two programmers and three artists.
We got the game finished within the two day period and I did some polishing up 
afterward. I also added in the sounds and music.

I created a collision system right away using AABB. Then I generated walls 
and the floor from tiles. I procedurally generated the walls position and color.
We also programmed a procedural background to create a unique feel every time.
Our artists exceeded above and beyond the requirements and created foreground 
objects. We did not have time to put them in during the game jam but I went 
back and added them in later. I also added a start screen, credits, 
Xbox controls and let the player replay the game without needing to leave 
the game. The other programmer spent a lot of time working on the animation 
of the robot as well as the controls of the robot.
